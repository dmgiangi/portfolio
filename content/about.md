# About Me

## Gianluigi De Marco - Senior Software Engineer

My name is Gianluigi De Marco, and I am a Senior Software Engineer specializing in BackEnd development with Java Spring. I have extensive experience in cloud computing, both on-premise and public cloud, particularly on Azure. My skills also include a strong understanding of microservices security, with a focus on protocols like OAuth2 and WebAuthN.

### Background and Experience

My passion for programming started when I was just 6 years old, with my father introducing me to coding on a Commodore 64. During high school, I began exploring C and Java, and since then, my career has revolved around BackEnd technologies, cloud computing, infrastructure and architectural patterns, and security protocols.

Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of being a key point of reference in every workplace I've been a part of. While I can't share specific project details due to privacy laws, I can proudly say that every project I've worked on has benefited from my dedication and expertise.

### Work Philosophy

I strongly adhere to the DevOps philosophy, integrating CI/CD practices into every aspect of my work. To me, professional development is a continuous process, and I dedicate time each day to learning and applying new knowledge. In more abstract terms, I believe in "throwing my heart over the obstacle" tackling every challenge with determination and passion.

### Personal Interests

Outside of work, I love cooking, especially for friends, and enjoying nature through camping. These interests allow me to recharge and maintain balance in my life.

### Professional Goals

My long-term goal is to work in a stimulating environment where colleagues can discuss not only the immediate challenges but also how to solve problems in a more general and innovative way.

### Favorite Quote

I’d like to conclude with a quotethat deeply inspires me:

> _蔵焼けて – 障るものなき – 月見哉_ \
> _"The barn’s burnt down – now I can see the moon"_
